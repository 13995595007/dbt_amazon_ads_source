ðŸŽ‰ This is the initial release of this package! ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes [Amazon Ads staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads_source/#!/overview/amazon_ads_source/models/?g_v=1&g_e=seeds), which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Amazon Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Names columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Amazon Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Amazon Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads).
- For more information refer to the [README](/README.md).
